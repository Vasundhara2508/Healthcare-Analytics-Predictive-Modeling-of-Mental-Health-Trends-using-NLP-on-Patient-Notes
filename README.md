#  Healthcare Analytics: Predictive Modeling of Mental Health Trends using NLP on Patient Notes

This project applies **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Machine Learning** techniques to analyze **clinical / patient notes** for detecting and predicting **mental health trends**. The objective is to transform unstructured medical text into meaningful insights that support healthcare decision-making.

---

##  Project Overview

Healthcare systems generate massive volumes of **unstructured textual data** (doctor notes, patient records, discharge summaries). These notes contain critical signals about mental health conditions but are difficult to analyze manually.

This project:

* Processes unstructured clinical text
* Applies NLP techniques for feature extraction
* Builds predictive ML models
* Identifies mental health patterns / trends
* Demonstrates healthcare analytics workflow

---

##  Problem Statement

Mental health indicators are often embedded in free-text clinical notes rather than structured fields. Traditional analytics miss these signals.

We aim to:

* Extract meaningful features from patient notes
* Detect patterns linked to mental health conditions
* Build predictive models for classification / trend analysis

---

##  Techniques Used

### ✔ Natural Language Processing (NLP)

* Text Cleaning & Normalization
* Tokenization
* Stopword Removal
* Vectorization (TF-IDF / Bag-of-Words)
* Feature Engineering

---

###  Machine Learning Models

Typical models explored may include:

* Logistic Regression
* Naive Bayes
* Support Vector Machine (SVM)
* Random Forest (if implemented)

---

###  Data Processing

* Handling missing values
* Label encoding / target preparation
* Train-test splitting

---

##  Dataset

The model expects a dataset containing:

* **Patient / Clinical Notes** (text data)
* **Target Labels** (mental health indicators or classes)

Example structure:

```
data.csv
    ├── notes (text)
    ├── label (target)
```

 Dataset is not included due to privacy / sensitivity considerations.

##  Features Implemented

✔ Text preprocessing pipeline

✔ NLP feature extraction

✔ Model training & evaluation

✔ Performance measurement

✔ Healthcare analytics interpretation
